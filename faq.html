                <h3 class="question">1. What is PDLC and how does it work?</h3>
                <p class="answer">PDLC stands for Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals. PDLC film contains liquid crystal droplets suspended in a polymer matrix. When powered, the crystals align to become transparent; when off, they scatter light for privacy. It’s like magic glass—switchable with a button, remote, or even a smartphone app.</p>

                <p class="answer">PDLC is our standard white-on-clear film. DDLC is our advanced color version - it incorporates dye molecules, so you can choose colors like blue, grey, or even custom shades. It’s perfect for branding or matching interior designs while still offering excellent shading.</p>
